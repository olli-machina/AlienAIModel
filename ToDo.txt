- AI uses NavMesh to navigate map
- FOV fully implemented
- Can see behind itself (limited distance)
- Will pursue the player when seen
- AI "Learns" from player actions
	- Increase probability of places(6 total) player hides more than once
	- Increase FOV behind hunter if player continues to follow them
